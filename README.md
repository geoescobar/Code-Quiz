# Homework 4 - Code Quiz

In this activity, I was able to generate and functionally operate a quiz contiaing questions to Javascript.

## Functionality 

* The quiz opens up by prompting you with a start button. Upon pressing the start button it will disappear and render question one. In the javascript file named "script.js" you will be able to find that code by referencing the comments.

* Once the questions appear after pressing start you will also see that the timer begins a countdown from 60. The countdown goes down by 1 seconde and if you get a question wrong it will have a decrement of 10 seconds. once the timer hits 0 if you have not completed the quiz it will end it and mark the remainding questions wrong. 

* The questions all have a hover effect that will let you see which one you're selecting and that will let you pick the one you think is correct and will let you know at the end of the quiz. 

* After clicking on the answer for the final question you will be prometed with your score which will then be alerted on the high scores portion at the top of the page. 

* Finally, once you see your score the start button will appear to give you the option to take the quiz again. 

* Within the javascript, html, and css there are comments explaining the various moving parts to this project that help as references understanding the functionality of each part.
